        I'm a {age} year old software engineer from germany.
        I'm into backend development, cloud infrastructure, and everything automation related.
        You can find me as <i>@jemand771</i> in most places on the internet.

    <p>
        I currently work at <a href="https://intenta.de">Intenta</a> as a backend developer.
        I spend most of my day writing Python and C++ with some build system and infrastructure adventures sprinkled in
        here and there.
        To balance out some of the low-level work there, I tinker with some more
        <Sparkles>cloud-native</Sparkles>
        technologies in my free time.
